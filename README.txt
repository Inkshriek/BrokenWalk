You are a nameless wanderer, who has just accepted an offer from an angel to meet with them at a holy ground. They warn of dangers in the dark that only they and their light can save you from. But is this danger truly real?

To solve the puzzles, you must pick up lamps and move them to light your way. Door triggers (the white circles) may require light to activate.

Once left on your own, be sure to walk back. Home is waiting.
